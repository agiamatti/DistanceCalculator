# 1. Pieces of Software:

1. **Customer-Facing App:** A mobile application for customers to place orders. This app would allow users to create accounts, place orders, track orders, and provide payment. As a secondary objective, this app can also be provided as a web app for additional convenience.
2. **Delivery Personnel App:** A separate mobile application for delivery personnel. This app would need to provide capabilities for order assignment, navigation, order status updates as well as handling payments to the delivery personnel.
3. **Backend API:** A server-side application to handle requests from both applications. It would communicate with the database to fulfill these calculations.
4. **Database** - It would need to store all kinds of data including user and delivery personnel information, payment processing, order history and all other related activities that enable the 2 first apps.
5. **Admin Dashboard:** A web application for business administrators to overview and manage the entire system. They would be able to view statistics, have elevated view of orders and accounts and handle disputes, if required.

# 2. Architecture:
I would choose a **Microservices Architecture**. Each piece of software should be developed and deployed separately, as each section would use different technologies fit for their respective specific purposes.

A monolithic approach would be simpler at the beginning but couldn't cover all these scenarios well enough and also would be harder to expand, maintain and deploy in the future as the service expands.

# 3. Work Methodology:
I would go with **Agile Scrum** methodology -- it is the one of the most used collaboration frameworks in software development and for good reason. It allows for iterative and incremental development, regular feedback, and flexibility to adapt to changes. It is particularly suited for our problem as well since weâ€™re developing a new product and adaptability - such as changes based on user feedback and market trends - will be quite important to our product's success.

# 4. Git Workflow:
I would use the **Git Feature Branch and Pull Request Workflow**. Each new feature or bug fix is developed in a separate branch, and code is merged into the main branch via pull requests. It allows multiple developers to simultaneously work in different areas increasing cooperation. It also provides the important ability to review code before it is merged to the main branch.

# 5. Team Members:
I think it would be beneficial, even in the beginning, to have an additional software engineer on the team. Having two developers would help with code reviews, parallel development and general collaboration particularly in the face of complex problems and challenges. Having two developers also insures knowledge retention and workflow progress if one of the engineers is unavailable or leaves altogether.

Further more, as the project expands, we should get dedicated engineers for front-end, back-end, devops and so on.

# 6. Other Considerations:
1. **Automated Testing:** To ensure the robustness of the software, automated testing must be a part of the process. Initially, we can begin with unit tests. And then expand the suite with integration tests, regression tests, and performance tests.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** CI/CD will enable automatic testing and deployment of code. This can be used as part of code reviews which will lead to great increases in efficiency and reduces the chances of human error.

3. **Application Performance Monitoring:** For a large applications which provides important, time-sensitive services to many, it is crucial to have optimal performance. APM is an indispensible tool to catch any issues early and ensure a great user experience.

4. **Scalability:** We should design our system to be able to scale from the start. Therefore, we should avoid taking shortcuts that would hinder the ability to expand the service as the user base grows.

5. **Security:** Similar to scalability, best security practices must be used from the start. As we will be working with payment processing and lots of personal information, data encryption, secure connections, and compliance standards must be reviewed. We should also put a focus on data minimization in general. Additionally, our systems must go through regular audits for security vulnerabilities.
